    "### Predicting Game Related Newsletter Subscription from Player Behavior\n",
    "Our project takes a closer look at if we can predict if a Minecraft player is subscribed to a newsletter based on their in game behavior. We looked at the player's age, session length, and total playtime in order to explore our prediction. We have been provided two datasets, players.csv with basic player information, and sessions.csv with recorded gameplay sessions. "
