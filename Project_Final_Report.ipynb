    "The Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence (PLAI), a computer science research group based at the University of British Columbia, has created a Minecraft server to collect hours of player data in an effort to train and create an AI model that can understand speech and respond to its environment. To recruit players to their study, PLAI must target recruitment towards individuals most likely to contribute hours' worth of data. Players' subscription to receive game-related newsletters is linked to hours of data they may contribute towards the study, as subscription demonstrates interest in engaging with the server. Assessing to what accuracy a player’s age, average session length, and total play time predict a player’s subscription status may allow researchers to target the best sources of data. The players and sessions datasets can be used to classify which characteristics are linked to subscription. A list of players’ in-game experience level, subscription status, hashed email, played hours, name, gender, and age is included in the players dataset, while each player’s hashed email alongside their start and end times are in the latter. By merging the two datasets, it is possible to produce statistical data and visualizations and predict the likelihood of a player subscribing to receive newsletters based on characteristics of existing players. In the sessions dataset, the start and end times of each player’s sessions were wrangled to figure out how long their sessions are in minutes, and players’ average play time per session was used alongside age and total hours played to predict the odds of new players with similar characteristics subscribing through KNN classification.\n"
